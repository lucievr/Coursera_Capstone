# Jupyter Notebook Capstone Project

#### Hello and welcome to my Jupyter Notebook Capstone Project Github page. This repository contains all the data and files related to my capstone project as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate course. Using the Foursquare API and Python data analysis tools, this project explores a number of neighbourhoods in the city of Amsterdam, Netherlands, in order to determine the most suitable location for opening a new restaurant.
